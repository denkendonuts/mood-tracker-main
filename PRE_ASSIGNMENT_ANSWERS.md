# Pre Assignment Questions

### What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

- having the animations present perfectly across all desktop viewports

### What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- A well defined mobile view

### List two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

I would incorporate features to turn it into more of a mood journal

- Calendar view
- Ability to elaborate more on your mood
- More varied mood types

### Are there any clarifying questions you would ask? If you're able to make assumptions about these and continue, please record and share your assumptions.

- What does a looping background include? 
    Since the motion annotations only mention looping the emoji and having transitional animations, I'll stick to that due to the time constraint.
- What is the initial state of the app supposed to be when there are no mood entries? 
    I'm going to have the mood picker modal displayed when there is no mood set
- Am I supposed to take into account accessibility and reduced motion needs? 
    The design meets contrast requirements and I am going to facilitate assistive technology navigation via the tab key, however due to the time constraint I wont be able to address reduced motion needs or more complex keyboard navigation.
